This is Internship Project

I developed a Unity project that includes a third-person camera view and basic car movement using a physics controller. The project consists of two scenes within the Scene Folder. The first scene offers third-person movement with animations, allowing the player to control a character. The second scene is a car game featuring a race track, where players can drive a car using the implemented physics controller.Screenshots are in screenshot Folder.
